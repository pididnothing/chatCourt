Notes
1. DataBase models should have been better planned.{
- If court profile was planned earlier, I could have included participant usernames as well within the courtRoom model. Now it requires extra api calls to fetch the usernames matching the userIDs.
- Had to change court elements (judge, proclients, proslawyers, etc.) to arrays midway to accomodate multiple users in each category.
}
2. CourtRoom Workflow should have been completely designed before starting programming{
- Ended up as a normal chatting interface.
- Requires a full revamp to create features such as verdict passing, presenting evidence and witnesses, citing precedent
